# 🛡️ Automated Network Scanner & Reporting Tool

This project provides an automated solution for local network vulnerability assessment using **Bash Scripting** and **Python 3**. It customizes the process from aggressive Nmap scanning to generating analyst-ready reports.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automation:** A single Bash script (`scanner.sh`) handles host discovery, Nmap execution, and file management.
* **Deep Scanning:** Uses aggressive Nmap flags (`-A`, `-v`, `-sV`, `-sC`) for service version detection and vulnerability scripting.
* **Reporting:** Generates raw Nmap XML files, clean text summaries, and detailed, browser-viewable **HTML reports** (the primary deliverable).

## 💻 Execution Command

To run the full scan and reporting process on a target subnet (replace the CIDR with your target):

```bash
sudo ./scripts/scanner.sh 172.20.10.0/28
