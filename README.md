1. Project Overview
The Automated Network Vulnerability Assessment Tool is a custom solution developed for the security auditing of a local network (VM lab environment). It uses a combination of Bash scripting, Python programming, and the Nmap tool to automate the entire vulnerability scanning and reporting process.

Goal: To establish a repeatable and efficient method for host discovery, aggressive vulnerability scanning, and generation of multi-format security reports.

Latest Scan Target: 172.20.10.0/28

Result: Successfully identified 3 active hosts and pinpointed 4 open ports/services on the gateway host (172.20.10.1).2. Technologies Used & Skills DemonstratedCategory,Tool/Language,Skill Highlighted
Scanning Engine,Nmap (v7.94SVN),"Executing aggressive scans (-A), version detection (-sV), and vulnerability script analysis (--script vuln)."
Automation,Bash Scripting (scanner.sh),"Orchestration of the workflow, file management, and creation of dynamic, timestamped logging (2025-11-18_03:30:46)."
Data Analysis,Python 3 (parse_nmap_xml.py),Programmatic parsing of the complex Nmap XML output to generate a simplified summary report.
Reporting,xsltproc,"Converting raw XML files into detailed, browser-viewable HTML reports."
Networking,ip a / DHCP,Confirmed network configuration (172.20.10.3/28) and host discovery on the subnet.3. Key Findings from the Last ScanThe comprehensive scan of the 172.20.10.0/28 network yielded the following findings:Host IP,Status,Open Ports/Services Found,Service Details
172.20.10.1,UP,"21, 53, 49152, 62078","Port 53 (DNS) showed an unrecognized service, and ports 21, 49152, and 62078 were tcpwrapped. This is the primary point of interest."
172.20.10.2,UP,None Found,"All 1000 ports were filtered (no-response), indicating an active firewall is dropping probe packets."
172.20.10.3,UP,None Found,"All 1000 ports were closed (reset), which is the local Kali host."4. How to Use the Tool
The entire assessment process is executed via a single Bash script.Navigate to the project directory:cd ~/network-scanner-project/Ensure scripts are executable:chmod +x scripts/scanner.shRun the script with the target network (CIDR notation):sudo ./scripts/scanner.sh 172.20.10.0/28Output and Report Locations
All output files are saved into the following directories:Directory,File Type,Purpose,Example File
